# Clivon — Focused YouTube Experience (Electron Edition)

Clivon is a **native desktop application** (built with Electron) that transforms YouTube into a focused, distraction-free, productivity-first environment.

Unlike standard browsers, Clivon does not expose tabs, address bars, or browser chrome. It treats YouTube as a native app — providing a sleek, cinema-grade viewing experience.
