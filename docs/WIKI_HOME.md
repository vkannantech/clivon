# 👋 Welcome

**Clivon YouTube Desktop** is not just another wrapper. It is a re-engineered consumption engine built on **Tauri v2** and **Rust**. 

We rejected the industry standard of bloated Electron apps (which eat 500MB+ RAM for a simple tab) and built a **Native Window Architecture** that gives you the raw performance of a system browser with the utility of a dedicated application.

# 💎 Why Clivon?

### 🚀 1. Native Hyper-Browser Architecture
Most "YouTube Apps" are just Chromium browsers in disguise. We use a **Rust-powered Native Window** system.
*   **Result**: 0ms Input Lag. HDR Support. 4K/8K Native Decoding.
*   **Bypass**: Our architecture natively bypasses `X-Frame-Options` and strict 403 blocks that plague other web-view wrappers.

### 🛡️ 2. Privacy-First Core
We don't just show you the site; we sanitize it.
*   **Tracker Blocking**: Known tracking domains from ad-tech giants are blocked at the network request level before they even load.
*   **Clean UI**: No sidebars, no clutter. Just the content.

### 🎭 3. True Multitasking (Mini Player)
The Mini Player isn't a "gimmick"—it's a productivity tool.
*   **Always-on-Top**: Floats above your work (Word, VS Code, Photoshop).
*   **Borderless**: Blends seamlessly into your desktop environment.
*   **Crash-Guard**: Intelligent environment detection ensures stability.
